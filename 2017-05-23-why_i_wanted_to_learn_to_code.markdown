I've always had a passion for technology since I was teenager and creating a web app or a website has always been something I wanted to do. So, a few years ago I purchased a HTML/CSS course on Udemy but I put off starting the course for months because "it wasn't the right time". I knew I would enjoy it but I think I felt intimidated to start. One day about 2 years ago, I sat down and started the course and I was immediately hooked! My first website looked awful but it was something I made on my own, to me, that was exciting! After HTML/CSS, I ventured on to mobile development with Swift iOS before discovering Ruby and JavaScript, which I do enjoy learning a little bit more. I have a few friends that have been developers for years and they love their jobs, since I love coding, I would love a career as a web developer, doing something I love!
