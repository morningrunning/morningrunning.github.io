<p>My name is Ronald Morgan and I currently live in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio. I have a passion for technology, particularly the desire to programming. I started to learn to code on my own a few years ago and immediately enjoyed every aspect of it! Before taking the leap into tech, I taught English in Brazil, was a mortgage consultant in New York and an environmental surveyor in Baltimore. I recently enrolled in Flatiron School's Web Developer Program to be a part of great community with those that share my passion for tech while increasing my development knowledge and skill set.</p>
